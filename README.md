# centrex-state-prep
Code for running state preparation simulations for CeNTREX

## Getting started
- Make sure you have Python installed, e.g. as part of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- I suggest creating a clean virtual environment, e.g. using an Anaconda Prompt and conda by running `conda create --name [new environment name] python`.
- Install `centrex_TlF` in the new environment by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/ograsdijk/CeNTREX-TlF)
- [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository, [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the forked repository to you local machine, and then run `python setup.py install` in the root folder of the repository to install the  package and its dependencies.
- Install [jupyter/jupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install). If using conda you can run `conda install jupyter` or `conda install jupyterlab --channel conda-forge`.
- You should then be able to run the example Jupyter notebooks in `./examples/`. This is the best place to start learning how to use the package.
